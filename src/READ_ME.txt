Run the DB-CONFIG.TXT file in your MySQL browser.

DB-Connector and connect.php uses the following db data:

$db_server = "localhost";
$db_name = "kodiak";
$db_user = "root";
$db_passwd = "1234";

By default, the admin login is 'admin', '1234';

Obviously, from the state of our project, we ran into some pretty
serious problems early. Getting started was hard, but not working at
cross purposes was harder. Google drive is not meant for collab coding
We redesigned the front end at least twice, and each time it broke
the back end completely. Andrew had at least three versions he was working
on: The version tied to Apache, the version tied to Web Matrix and
the "pushed" version tied to Google Drive. Keeping all the files 
current was a major chore. Next project, we will use a tool built
for collab coding, like GitBash. Keeping the scrum board updated was
a full time job.

We think our main problem was a problem of mindset. Andrew specifically
was stuck "outprioritizing" this project with other schoolwork. If
the sprints were better planned, or more was at stake, we don't think
that would have occured.

At least our front end is pretty.
